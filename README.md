# Natural Language Phone Book Application
A phone book application that interprets natural language commands using OpenAI's LLM

A digital phone book application that allows users to manage contacts using natural language commands. The application uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model to interpret user commands and perform appropriate actions on the contacts database.

## Features

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Use everyday language to manage your contacts instead of specific commands
- **Contact Management**:
  - Add new contacts with name and phone number
  - Retrieve contact information by name
  - Search for contacts by phone number
  - Update existing contact phone numbers
  - Delete contacts from the phone book
  - View all contacts in the phone book
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clean and simple web-based interface built with Gradio
- **Example Commands**: Pre-populated example prompts to help users get started

## Technical Details

- **Web Framework**: Gradio for the user interface
- **Database**: SQLite for contact storage
- **Natural Language Processing**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo for command interpretation
- **Environment Management**: dotenv for API key management

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/malwinabelczewska/Phonebook-app.git
   cd Phonebook-app
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```
   You can obtain an API key at [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/).

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://127.0.0.1:7860)

3. Enter commands using natural language. Examples:
   - "Add John to my phone book with number 123456789"
   - "What is the phone number for John?"
   - "Who's number is 123456789?"
   - "Update John's number to 987654321"
   - "Show me the full phone book"
   - "Delete contact for John"

## How It Works

1. When a user enters a command, it's sent to the OpenAI API with a system prompt that defines the expected response format.
2. The LLM interprets the command and returns a structured JSON response containing:
   - The intended action (add, get, list, update, delete)
   - The contact name (if applicable)
   - The phone number (if applicable)
   - A confidence score
3. The application then executes the appropriate database operation based on the interpreted command.
4. If the confidence score is too low, the application asks for clarification.

## Database Structure

The application uses a simple SQLite database with a single `contacts` table:
- `id`: Unique identifier (primary key)
- `name`: Contact name
- `phone`: Phone number
